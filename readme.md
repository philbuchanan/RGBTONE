# RGBTONE

RGBTONE is a simple HEX to RGB (and vise versa) color converting app.

It also allows you to save colors for later using local storage. To save a color simple press enter on your keyboard with either the HEX or RGB input focused.

The current version (3.0) has only been tested in (however it should work in some older browsers too):

- Safari 7+
- Chrome 35+
- Firefox 28+
- Mobile Safari in iOS 7 (iPhone and iPad)
